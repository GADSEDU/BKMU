               <p>As Allah Say in the Quran:
               O ye who believe! fear Allah as He should be feared; and let not death overtake you except when you are 
               in a state of submission.
               And hold fast, all together, by the rope of Allah and be not divided; and remember the favors of 
               Allah which He bestowed upon you when you were enemies and He united your hearts in love, so that by 
               His grace you became as brothers; and you were on the brink of a pit of fire and He saved you from it. 
               Thus does Allah explain to you His commandments that you may be guided.
               And let there be among you a body of men who should invite to goodness, and enjoin equity and forbid evil. 
               And it is they who shall prosper. (Q3:102-104)
